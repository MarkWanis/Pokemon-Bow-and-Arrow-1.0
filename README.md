The *Pokemon-Bow-and-Arrow-1.0* project is a Python-based, text-driven adventure game that simulates a classic Pokémon journey, combining RPG exploration and turn-based battle mechanics. Using modules such as `base_stats`, `pokemon_stats`, and `place_functions`, the game allows players to choose between Charmander, Bulbasaur, or Squirtle as a starter Pokémon. It uses the Replit database (`replit.db`) to store persistent player data like team stats, collected Pokémon, and location progress. Players can explore towns and routes from Pallet Town to Victory Road, encounter and battle wild Pokémon, and progress through gym and Elite Four challenges. The main game loop handles player navigation, while the `wild_pokemon_encounter()` function governs battle logic—calculating attack order, move accuracy, type effects, and health or status updates. The game integrates YAML for configuration, resulting in an expansive, modular text RPG experience that closely mirrors the structure and mechanics of the original Pokémon games.
